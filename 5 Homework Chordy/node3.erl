% ============The Node============

% That only handles a growing ring
% A node needs to have the following properties:
%  1) Key
%  2) Predecessor
%  3) Successor
% We need to know tha key values of both predecessor and successor
% This will be represented like: {Key, Pid}

% The messages we need to maintain in the ring are:
%  1) {key, Qref, Peer} -> a peer needs to know our key
%  2) {notify, New} -> a new node informs us of its existence
%  3) {request, Peer} -> s predecessor needs to know our predecessor
%  4) {status, Pred} -> our successor informs us about its predecessor

% We need to make the things asynchronous

node(Id, Predecessor, Successor, Store, Next) ->

        % procedure.
        % The procedure schedule stabilize/1 is called when a node is created
        % Add scheduled stabilization and probing
        stabilize ->

        % add storage
        % The Qref parameters will be used to tag
        % the return message to the Client.
        % This allows the client to identify

    end.

% ============Adding an element============

% To add a new key value we must first determine if our node is the node that
% should take care of the key. A node will take care of all keys from (but not
% including) the identifier of its predecessor to (and including) the identifier
% of itself. If we are not responsible we simply send a add message to our
% successor.

% add key-value pair, return updated storage
add(Key, Value, Qref, Client, Id, {Pkey, _, _}, {_, _, Spid}, Store) ->
    case key:between(Key, Pkey, Id) of
        true ->
            Client ! {Qref, ok},
            storage:add(Key, Value, Store);
        false ->
            Spid ! {add, Key, Value, Qref, Client}
    end.

% ============Lookup procedure============

% The lookup procedure is very similar, we need to do the same test to determine if we are responsible for the key. If so we do a simple lookup in
% the local store and then send the reply to the requester. If it is not our
% responsibility we simply forward the request.

% return {Key, Value} or false
lookup(Key, Qref, Client, Id, {Pkey, _, _}, {_, _, Spid}, Store) ->
    case key:between(Key, Pkey, Id) of
        true ->
            Result = storage:lookup(Key, Store),
            Client ! {Qref, Result};
        false ->
            Spid ! {add, Key, Qref, Client}
    end.

% ============Responsibility============

handover(Id, Store, Nkey, Npid) ->
    {Updated, Rest} = storage:split(Id, Nkey, Store),
    Npid ! {handover, Rest},
    Updated.

% ============Stabilize============

% The periodic stabilize procedure will consist of a node sending
% a {request, self()} message ot its successor and then expecting
% a {status, Pred} in return.
% When it knows the predecessor if its successor it can check
%   1) If the ring is stable or
%   2)  Ff the successor needs to be notifies  about its existence through
% a {notify, {Id, self()} message

% Pred -> is ours successors current predecessor
%   1) If this i nil we should of course inform it about our existence
%   2) If it is pointing back to us we don't have to do anything
%   3) If it is pointing to itself we should of course notify it about our existence

% If the key of the predecessor of our successor (Xkey)
% is between us and our successor we should of course adopt this node as our
% successor and run stabilization again. If we should be in between the nodes
% we inform our successor of our existence.

% Stabilize procedure is simply send a request message to its successor

% Input vars:
% Pred = Current predecessor of the successor
% Id = Id of the current node
% Successor = Successor of the current node
stabilize(Pred, Next, Id, Successor) ->
    %%  io:format("Starting stab: Pred - ~w, Id - ~w Succ - ~w Next  ~w ~n", [Pred, Id, Successor, Next]),
    {Skey, Sref, Spid} = Successor,
    case Pred of
        nil ->
            Spid ! {notify, {Id, self()}},
            {Successor, Next};
        {Id, _} ->
            {Successor, Next};
        {Skey, _} ->
            Spid ! {notify, {Id, self()}},
            {Successor, Next};
        {Xkey, Xpid} ->
            case key:between(Xkey, Id, Skey) of
                % new successor
                true ->
                    % adopt this node as our successor
                    Xpid ! {request, self()},
                    drop(Sref),

                    self() ! stabilize,
                    {{Xkey, Xref, Xpid}, Successor};
                false ->
                    Spid ! {notify, {Id, self()}},
                    {Successor, Next}
            end
    end.

stabilize({_, _, Spid}) ->
    %io:format("Self request ~n", []),
    Spid ! {request, self()}.

% ============Request============

% The stabilize procedure must be done with regular internals so that new
% nodes are quickly linked into the ring.
% This can be arranged by stating a TIMER that sends a stabilize message
% after a specific time.

schedule_stabilize() ->
    timer:send_interval(?Stabilize, self(), stabilize).

% The request message is picked up by a
% process and the request/2 procedure is called
% We should of course only inform the peer that sent the
% request about or predecessor
request(Peer, Predecessor, {Nkey, _, Npid}) ->
    case Predecessor of
        nil ->
            Msg = {status, Predecessor, {Nkey, Npid}},
            %%      io:format("Sent status Msg ~w~n", [Msg]),
            Peer ! Msg;
        {Pkey, _, Ppid} ->
            %%      io:format("Sent status with Pred:  ~w~n", [{Pkey, Ppid}]),
            Peer ! {status, {Pkey, Ppid}, {Nkey, Npid}}
    end.

% ============Notify2============

% Being notified of a node is a way for a node to make a friendly proposal that
% it might be our proper predecessor
% But we need to have our own investigation

% Handling of a notify message could mean that we have to give
% part of a store away; we need to pass the store as an argument also return
% a tuple {Predecessor, Store}.

notify({Nkey, Npid}, Id, Predecessor, Store) ->

        {Pkey, Pref, _} ->
            case key:between(Nkey, Pkey, Id) of
